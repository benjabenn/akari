# Akari

This application uses the model-view-controller design pattern from the _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_ book together with the JavaFX UI library to create a fully-fledged implementation of [Akari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Up_(puzzle)), a logic puzzle [game](https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/) similar to Sudoku or Minesweeper.
